            In the game two players face off against one another, one side
            playing as &quot;blue&quot;, the other as &quot;red&quot; on a 3x3
            grid. Each player has five cards in a hand and the aim is to capture
            the opponent&apos;s cards by turning them into the player&apos;s own
            color of red or blue.
          </p>
          <p>
            To win, a majority of the total ten cards played (including the one
            card that is not placed on the board) must be of the player&apos;s
            card color. To do this, the player must capture cards by placing a
            card adjacent to an opponent&apos;s card whereupon the
            &apos;ranks&apos; of the sides where the two cards touch will be
            compared. If the rank of the opponent&apos;s card is higher than the
            player&apos;s card, the player&apos;s card will be captured and
            turned into the opponent&apos;s color. If the player&apos;s rank is
            higher, the opponent&apos;s card will be captured and changed into
            the player&apos;s color instead.{' '}
